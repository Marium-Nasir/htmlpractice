    <h1>INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER SCIENCE</h1>
    <p align = "left"><b>The field encompasses theory, mathematical activities such as design and analysis of algorithms, performance studies of systems and their components, and estimation of reliability and availability of systems by probabilistic techniques. Because computer systems are often too large and complicated for failure or success of a design to be predicted without testing, experimentation is built into the development cycle.</b></p>
